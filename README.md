# Classification-of-Coherence
Data generation and neural network scripts for classifying the coherence of states.

- __simulation_pm_final.py__ : Final simulation code  
- __ANN.py__ : ANN for pure states  
- __CNN1.py__ : CNN for pure states  
- __CNN3.py__ : Improved CNN for mixed states  
- __CNN4.py__ : Same as __CNN3.py__, adapted slightly for a larger data set  
- __assessment_simulation_p.py__ : Generates states used for further assessment of model
- __assessment_p.py__ : Inference of states used for further assessment
